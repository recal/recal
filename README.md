# ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

I'm a Software Engineer at [Azalea](https://github.com/azaleateam)<br/>
I specialize in backend development and handle devops tasks from time to time.

# Languages and Tools

As of recent, I've been writing a lot of miscellaneous tooling in Nim but my day-to-day stack consists of:<br/>
- Svelte or Next.js for web development.
- Go, Nim, or TypeScript on the backend, depending on the project.
- Kotlin for Minecraft-related services/projects.

Although, this changes rather frequently as I pick up new languages to experiment with.
